summary: "Tic-Tac-Toe game that I developed in ICS 211"
---
This Java project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using the Swing library for the graphical user interface. The program creates a 3x3 grid of buttons that players can interact with to place their moves. The user plays as "X" while the computer generates random moves as "O." The game checks for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal wins after each move, and once a winner is determined, the remaining buttons are disabled. A message dialog is displayed to announce the result, and the outcome is also written to a text file.
