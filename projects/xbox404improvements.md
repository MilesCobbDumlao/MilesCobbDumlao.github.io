During my Microsoft Explore internship, I worked on improving the Xbox.com 404 page. The existing page was static, which meant that the Xbox marketing team could not update its content without going through a developer. This created challenges, especially since Xbox is a global product and certain regions do not sell Xbox consoles. For example, the hardcoded “browse consoles” link was not relevant for every market. To address this, my team and I designed and implemented a dynamic 404 page that gave the marketing team the ability to update and customize the content themselves, improving both flexibility and user experience across regions.

The project team included me and two other interns. We divided the work into two major parts: a hero component and a cards component. I was responsible for building the hero component, which included an image, title, and description for the new 404 page. In addition to replicating the basic structure, I designed and implemented a new feature, a “Back to Home” button, to give users an immediate path back to the xbox.com homepage when they encounter a 404 error on xbox.com. This work required close collaboration with my teammates, regular feedback from mentors, and coordination with the marketing team to ensure their needs were met.

Through this project, I developed a range of technical and design skills. I learned how to build reusable components using TypeScript with React, as well as how to navigate a large-scale production codebase and integrate my work with existing functionality. I also gained experience with HTML, JSX, and styling tools such as CSS Flexbox and Grid. Beyond coding, I learned how to create wireframes and mockups using Figma, which allowed me to translate design discussions into functional UI/UX elements. Overall, the experience gave me both technical depth and confidence in working on real-world, collaborative projects at scale.
