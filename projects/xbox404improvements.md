Developed an improved 404 page for the xbox.com website as a Microsoft Explore intern. The current 404 page is static and doesn't allow the marketing team to edit the page without a developer. The 404 page being static is problematic, as Xbox is a global product, and certain regions don't allow Xbox consoles. The browse consoles link that's hardcoded into the page is problematic for users in regions that don't sell Xbox consoles. So my podmates and I created an improved 404 page that allowed the Xbox marketing team to edit the 404 page without a developer.
