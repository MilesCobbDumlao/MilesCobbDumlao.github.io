summary: "A python project I built to find files I didn't use for 30 days."

In college, I would have to frequently download files and worksheets. By the end of each semester, I would have a lot of files in my downloads folder and screenshots on my desktop. This made it hard to figure out which files I was actually using and which files were irrelevant. So I created a Python project to find files I didn't use for a month and put them all in one folder so I could see all the irrelevant files in one place.
