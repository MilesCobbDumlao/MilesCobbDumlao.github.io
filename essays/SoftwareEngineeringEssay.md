## A Spark of Interest

I was first drawn to software engineering when I took AP Computer Science Principles in high school. In school, I leaned more toward math and logical thinking, and computer science incorporated those strengths while also encouraging creative problem-solving. More recently, I completed a Microsoft Explore internship where I was able to experience both product management and software engineering. That opportunity showed me the breadth of careers a computer science degree can open up and gave me a stronger sense of direction in the field.

## Why It Matters to Me

What excites me most about software engineering is the ability to build things that help others. I see opportunities not only in web development and security but especially in AI, which is rapidly influencing fields far beyond computer science. I also have personal interests in fitness, nutrition, and finance, and I would love to build software that empowers people in those areas. For me, software engineering is meaningful because it combines technical skills with real-world impact.

## Skills I Want to Sharpen

There are many skills in software engineering that I want to improve upon. One of them is web development, since small businesses will always need websites to generate traction and connect with customers. I also aspire to one day start my own business. While I do not yet know exactly what that business will be, I know that most ventures today require a strong digital presence, and web development will be a crucial skill to have. Another area I want to sharpen is my ability to use and understand AI. AI is changing the world rapidly, and I want to leverage it to boost my productivity not only in coding and software engineering but also in other areas of life. Finally, I want to strengthen my ability to communicate and collaborate with others. Human connection is a skill that AI will never replace, and I see it as essential for success in this field.

## Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, I want to have the confidence and technical ability to bring my ideas to life through code. My goal is to build software that improves peopleâ€™s lives, particularly in areas I care about, such as fitness, nutrition, and finance. I also hope to gain the experience necessary to develop websites and mobile applications that reach real users and create value. Ultimately, I see myself using software engineering not only as a career path but also as a way to create meaningful tools that make a difference.
