## A spark of interest
I was first drawn to software engineering when I took AP Computer Science Principles in high school. In school I leaned more towards math and logical thinking and computer science incorporated those things on top of creative thinking. 
## Why it matters to me
What excites me about software engineering is being able to build things that help others. There's also a lot of opportunities in web development, security, and especially AI. All of those things have impact on fields outside of computer science. I have personal interests in fitness, nutrition, and finance and I would love to be able to build software that help people in those areas. 

## Skills I want to sharpen
There are many skills in Software engineering that I want to improve upon. One of them is web development.

## Looking ahead
If I have an idea, I'd be able to bring it to life through code
Build things that help people in areas I'm interested in, like Fitness, nutrition, and finance
Building websites and mobile apps
