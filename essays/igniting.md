## Thoughts on TypeScript

So far, I’ve really enjoyed working with TypeScript. Since it is a superset of JavaScript, many of the assignments we’ve done feel familiar, but the addition of data types makes the code much more readable and easier to understand. Compared to JavaScript, I appreciate how TypeScript forces me to be more intentional with how I structure my code. I may be a little biased since I had some exposure to TypeScript this past summer during my Microsoft Explore internship, but that experience also showed me how useful it can be in a professional setting.

From a software engineering perspective, I think TypeScript is a strong choice for web development. While I’m not an expert, I can see how it helps create scalable projects by improving readability and making collaboration easier. TypeScript also catches bugs earlier in the process and enforces better structure, which in turn makes projects more maintainable. Overall, I think it provides a solid foundation for building larger applications compared to plain JavaScript.

## Athletic Software Engineering

In ICS 314: Software Engineering, I was introduced to the idea of athletic software engineering. Each week, we complete “Workouts of the Day” (WODs), which are essentially timed projects. Typically, there are two: a practice WOD that we can work on collaboratively and a graded WOD with similar requirements. For each WOD, we’re given directions and asked to implement specific features and test cases within a time limit.

I’ve found this style of learning to be both challenging and useful. On one hand, the timed nature of the WODs reminds me of technical interviews, where you’re asked to solve a problem under pressure. On the other hand, the focus of the WODs is different—technical interviews often emphasize data structures and algorithms, while WODs center more on applied coding tasks. Similarly, in real software engineering jobs, projects do have deadlines, but they’re not usually timed to the minute like in class. That said, I still think the WODs are valuable. They push me to think quickly, manage stress, and practice writing functional code under constraints. Even though I haven’t passed the last couple, the process has highlighted areas I need to improve in, and I believe it will help me grow as a programmer.
