## How to Question
Asking good questions is the key to getting good answers. I know that last sentence is vague but I think it get's the point accross. Effecient questions can really boost ones understanding and allow us to reach meaningful conclusions. But how should we ask questions so that we can get arrive at meaningful answers? I just read "How to ask questions the smart way," by Eric Raymond and I found it really insightful. It reinforced a lot of thigns I believed prior to reading it. Last summer I got my first job as a Cybersecurity intern at Alaka'ina. It was good introduction to cybersecurity but the most important takeaway was the right way to ask questions in tech. I was told that you're bound to encounter a problem you'll be stuck on. But you have a job to do so you need to get unstuck on whatever problem you're facing. The best way is to ask for help from team mates. They're working with you so it's likely that they've come accross the same issues at some point and can probably get you unstuck. Now I was told that before asking you're question it's important to document what you've tried so far to unstuck yourself. Everyone has a job to do so it's important that you document your efforts so that the person helping you doesn't feel like they're doing your job. Secondly it gives the person context on what you're trying to do which can lead to fixing the problem. 

## "Smart" questions on Stack Overflow
As an example of a "smart" question I looked at stack overflow and filtered out questions by highest rating. One of the questions was asking "Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?" The asker provided complete, runnable code in both C++ and Java, detailed timing results, and their own hypothesis. Because the question was carefully constructed, it attracted thoughtful answers about cache optimization, branch prediction, and CPU behavior. This illustrates how asking questions the “smart” way generates deeper, more educational responses.
