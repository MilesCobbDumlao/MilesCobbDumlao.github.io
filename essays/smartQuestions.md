## How to Question

Asking good questions is the key to getting good answers. While that may sound obvious, the way we frame questions can make the difference between receiving meaningful help and being ignored. Efficient and precise questions not only clarify what we want to know but also encourage better answers. After reading How to Ask Questions the Smart Way by Eric Raymond, I realized how essential this skill is in software engineering. His advice reinforced many lessons I first learned as a cybersecurity intern at Alakaʻina. My team emphasized that when you get stuck, you must first try to solve the issue on your own and document those attempts. This way, when you ask teammates for help, you show respect for their time and provide the context they need to guide you effectively. This practice taught me that smart questions are not just about getting answers quickly; they are about collaborating productively.

## “Smart” Questions on Stack Overflow

A strong example of a smart question comes from [Stack Overflow: “Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array)
. The asker provided complete and runnable code in both C++ and Java, detailed timing results, and their own hypothesis about performance differences. This careful preparation attracted detailed answers from the community about cache optimization, branch prediction, and CPU behavior. The responses were highly technical and educational, going beyond simply “fixing” the issue to deepen the asker’s and readers’ understanding of computer architecture. This shows how a well-constructed question, following Raymond’s principles, can generate effective, efficient, and lasting value for the entire developer community.

## Not so “Smart” Questions

Knowing what a "smart" question looks like is helpful, but knowing what a not-so-smart question looks like can also be just as helpful. I tried to find a not-so-smart question on Stack Overflow, but there's no way to filter questions by lowest rating; you can only filter by the highest rated questions. Instead, I got ChatGPT to generate a question that violates asking questions the "smart way." Here's the example: 
Please Help Urgently!!!
hi guys my code doesn’t work :(
I’m trying to make a website but it just keeps breaking. Can anyone tell me what’s wrong????
it should work but it doesn’t.
thanks in advance I’m new lol

This violates multiple principles Raymond describes. The asker provides no code, no error messages, no description of what they have tried, and uses vague language like “it just keeps breaking.” The urgency and informal tone (“lol,” “please help urgently”) further reduce the likelihood of receiving serious answers. If a question like this appeared on Stack Overflow, it would likely receive unhelpful responses such as “share your code,” sarcastic comments, or even downvotes without solutions. In this way, asking a question the “not smart” way not only wastes the asker’s time but also discourages others from engaging meaningfully.

## Insights

This exercise highlighted the difference between questions that open doors and questions that close them. "Smart" questions, ones that are detailed, respectful, and well-researched, often generate rich and educational discussions that benefit not just the asker but the broader community as well. On the other hand, poorly framed questions fail to create useful responses and may even harm the asker’s reputation. As someone who wants to become a future software engineer, I see the value of applying Raymond’s guidelines in my academic, professional, and personal projects. Whether working on a team or just asking for help online, I now understand that how I ask is just as important as what I ask.
