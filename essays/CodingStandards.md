## First Impressions of ESLint
This week was the first week I used ESLint, and at first, it felt really tedious and intimidating to see all these red marks on my code, which normally wouldn't be there. At first, I found it frustrating to see all these red marks and errors in my code, even though it was only stylistic errors and not functional ones. But as I used ESLint more and more I found it to be pretty useful. I began to realize that it would help me find errors sooner. There's also a useful command to fix a lot of ESLint errors which is to use 'command' + '.' and it would auto-fix a bunch of ESLint errors. I could also pair the ESLint error messages with CoPilot to fix my code, which would output pretty good coding results. 

## Bigger picture 
Even though my initial impression was that it was tedious and intimidating to see all these ESLint errors on code that wouldn't normally have all those errors, I think I realize why ESLint is important. When it comes to software engineering, the odds of being a sole contributor to a repository are probably VERY unlikely. I used to think the style of code didn't really matter as long as it worked; it's good. But for collaboration and for other people to build off your code, they need to be able to read it, and having a tool to enforce a certain styling of code can boost readability, which boosts collaboration. I also realized that ESLint allows developers to catch bugs earlier. As a developer, you wouldn't want to push code with bugs to the main branch, so I now see the benefits of ESLint. 

## Removing the Art of Computer Science
As mentioned earlier, there are different styles of writing code. In that sense, Computer Science and Software Engineering can almost be looked at as an art. ESLint removes that art aspect. But I don't think that's a bad thing. Even though it can be aesthetically pleasing to see a bunch of different styles and ways of writing code to achieve a certain result, I think that the artistic aspect of software engineering would make it really hard to collaborate. In the previous weeks, we were introduced to 2 philosophies in software engineering. There was an Object-Oriented way of programming and a functional way to program. Both can be used to achieve the same result, but if there were 2 developers, one who was a die-hard object-oriented programmer and the other a functional programming lover, collaboration would likely be hard. But ESLint would force both developers to a compromise, boosting collaboration, or at least I'd hope so. I don't know, I've only had a week of experience with ESLint, so I don't have the best understanding of the tool, but I've come to a lot of realizations upon using it.
